The following tab components are being imported remotely from "bravo-app".

Notice that your browser's route is `/routing/<foo|bar>` depending on which tab is active.

If you open [https://app2.local.dev.com](https://app2.local.dev.com) you will see the same tab components at the root level.

The "Bar" tab also lazily renders the styled-component `Button` from the [UI Library](https://app3.local.dev.com) demo only when rendered.
